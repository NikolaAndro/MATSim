2021-11-16T09:07:17,285  WARN DrtConfigGroup:268 qsim.endTime should be specified and qsim.simEndtimeInterpretation should be 'onlyUseEndtime' if postponed request rejection is allowed. Otherwise, rejected passengers (who are stuck endlessly waiting for a DRT vehicle) will prevent QSim from stopping. Keep also in mind that not setting an end time may result in agents attempting to travel without vehicles being available.
