# MATSim â€“ Mixed Network on Pigou's Example

This example represents different modalities on the same network. At first, it is planned to contain only cars and taxis. Later on, there will be examples with additional modalities such as bicycles and walk.

For the sake of simpliocity Pigou's example is chosen for the network design.
