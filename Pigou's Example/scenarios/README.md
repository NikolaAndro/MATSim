# Scenarios

This folder contains scenarios to get started with taxi, DRT and AV modules. 
The scenarios included here are:

## Mielec 2014
A scenario roughly depicting the Polish city of Mielec. The scenario does not aim to re-semble reality, but is a good starting point for simple MaaS experiments. 
Example configs for both taxi and DRT are provided.

## Cottbus
This is an excerpt of the existing MATSim Cottbus scenario, depicting only inner-city traffic.
The scenario is described in [VSP-WP 11-12](https://svn.vsp.tu-berlin.de/repos/public-svn/publications/vspwp/2011/11-12/).
Example configs for both DRT and robotaxi are provided.
